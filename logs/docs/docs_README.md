# docs/

This folder is for screenshots and assets used in the README or documentation.

## Suggested screenshots to add

Once the site is live, grab these and drop them here:

- `screenshot-dark.png`  — full-page screenshot in dark mode
- `screenshot-light.png` — full-page screenshot in light mode
- `screenshot-mobile.png` — mobile view (use Chrome DevTools device toggle)

## How to take a good screenshot

In Chrome:
1. Open the site
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
4. Type "screenshot" → select **Capture full size screenshot**
5. Save to this folder

Then update README.md to include them:

```md
![Dark mode preview](docs/screenshot-dark.png)
```
